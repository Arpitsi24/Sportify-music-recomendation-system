# Music Recommendation system using Spotify Dataset


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to recommend songs for a given playlist. This project starts from data collection all the way to model deployment to ensure you have a working model to showcase.


#### Spotfiy API 
For this, we need a [Spotify for developers] (https://developer.spotify.com/) account. From here, go to the dashboard and “create an app”. Now, we can access a public and private key, needed to use the API.
